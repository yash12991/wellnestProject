# Meal Plan Generation - Onboarding Preferences Integration Fix

## Problem Identified
The meal plan generation system in `/backend/src/routes/message_routes.js` was NOT using the detailed user onboarding preferences when creating weekly meal plans. It was only using basic information and missing crucial personalization data.

## Issues Found

### Before Fix:
The AI prompt only included:
- Basic demographics (age, gender, height, weight)
- Generic "preferences" object conversion
- Limited goals from profile
- Food allergies

### Missing Critical Data:
- **Activity Level** (Inactive/Light/Moderate/Heavy)
- **Meat Preference** (Chicken/Pork/Beef/Fish/No Meat)
- **Specific Health Goals** (Energy, Sleep, Weight, Digestion)
- **Craving Patterns** (Type and frequency)
- **Digestive Issues** (Frequency of upset)
- **Energy Fatigue Time** (When user feels low energy)
- **Medical Conditions** (Diabetic, allergic, etc.)
- **Foods to Avoid** (Specific foods user wants to exclude)
- **Other Preferences** (Free text preferences)

## Root Cause
The meal plan generation was using a simple string conversion of preferences instead of extracting and utilizing the structured onboarding data stored in `user.preferences`.

## Files Fixed

### `/backend/src/routes/message_routes.js`

**Changes Made:**

1. **Replaced simple preferences conversion** with comprehensive `userContext` object:
```javascript
// OLD: Simple string conversion
let preferencesText = Object.entries(user.preferences).map(...).join("; ");

// NEW: Structured user context extraction
const userContext = {
  activityLevel: user.preferences?.activityLevel || 'Moderate',
  meatPreference: user.preferences?.meatPreference || 'Any',
  goals: user.preferences?.goals || 'General wellness',
  // ... all detailed preferences
};
```

2. **Enhanced AI prompt** to include comprehensive user profile:
```javascript
// OLD: Basic prompt
`Generate a 7-day Indian meal plan for:
- Age: ${profile?.age}
- Gender: ${user.gender}
- Preferences: ${preferencesText}`

// NEW: Detailed personalization prompt
`Generate a personalized 7-day Indian meal plan using comprehensive user profile:

BASIC PROFILE: ...
DETAILED HEALTH & LIFESTYLE PREFERENCES: ...
RESTRICTIONS & ALLERGIES: ...`
```

3. **Updated personalization requirements** with 10 specific rules:
- Strict meat preference compliance
- Activity level-based calorie adjustment
- Health goal-targeted meal suggestions
- Craving pattern consideration
- Digestive issue accommodation
- Energy timing optimization
- Medical condition compliance
- Foods to avoid enforcement
- Allergy safety
- Additional preference integration

## User Onboarding Data Now Used in Meal Plans

### From `user.preferences`:
- âœ… `activityLevel`: Adjusts calories and portions
- âœ… `meatPreference`: Controls protein sources (including No Meat option)
- âœ… `goals`: Targets specific health objectives
- âœ… `cravingType`: Includes healthy alternatives for cravings
- âœ… `cravingsFrequency`: Adjusts satisfaction levels
- âœ… `digestiveUpset`: Modifies spice levels and ingredients
- âœ… `fatigueTime`: Times energy-boosting meals appropriately
- âœ… `medicalConditions`: Ensures medical compliance
- âœ… `foodsToAvoid`: Excludes unwanted foods completely
- âœ… `otherPreferences`: Incorporates free-text preferences

### From user profile:
- âœ… Physical characteristics for calorie calculation
- âœ… Food allergies for safety
- âœ… Weight goals for appropriate nutrition

## Impact on Meal Plan Generation

### Now the AI will create meal plans that:
1. **Respect dietary choices** - No meat dishes if user selected "No Meat"
2. **Match activity levels** - Higher protein/calories for "Heavy" activity users
3. **Target health goals** - Energy-boosting breakfasts for "More energy" goals
4. **Consider digestion** - Milder foods for users with frequent digestive issues
5. **Time nutrition** - Strategic meal timing based on energy patterns
6. **Account for medical needs** - Diabetic-friendly options when specified
7. **Avoid problematic foods** - Completely exclude foods user wants to avoid
8. **Satisfy cravings healthily** - Include healthy alternatives for frequent cravers
9. **Ensure allergy safety** - Strict allergen avoidance
10. **Personalize culturally** - Match regional and cultural food preferences

## Example Transformation

**Before (Generic):**
```
- Preferences: meatPreference: Chicken; goals: Weight loss; activityLevel: Heavy
```

**After (Personalized):**
```
DETAILED HEALTH & LIFESTYLE PREFERENCES:
- Activity Level: Heavy
- Meat Preference: Chicken
- Primary Health Goals: Weight loss
- Craving Type: Carbs
- Digestive Issues: Never
- Medical Conditions: None
[Plus 6 more detailed categories]
```

**Result:** AI now generates meal plans with:
- Higher protein for Heavy activity
- Chicken-based proteins (no pork/beef)
- Weight loss appropriate calories
- Healthy carb alternatives for cravings
- All other preferences considered
